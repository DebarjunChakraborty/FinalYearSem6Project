Testing of the web application and ML workflows was conducted using **Selenium IDE**:

- **Functional Tests**: Automated test suites for all user flows (registration, prediction, feedback submission).
- **Regression Tests**: Ensured that updates did not break existing functionality.
- **Cross-Browser Checks**: Verified UI consistency in Chrome, Firefox and Edge.
- **Test Reports**: Generated HTML reports summarising pass/fail statuses for each test case.

## 📌 Future Enhancements

- Integrate with real-time insurance providers for dynamic quotes.
- Add regional language voice-assist.
- Develop an Android app for offline access.
- Extend to include health diagnostics (e.g., sugar levels, BP trends).
- Implement OTP-based login for rural authentication.
